                Hey, this is Barath, I'm a pre-final year CS undergrad.I love developing front end applications and devising creative solutions to intricate problems.
                I'm a curious learner and a passion driven person about the things I do. I give my 100% even in getting the minute fragments of the whole process right.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Apart from this, given a ticket to travel. I would pack my bag rather than asking for the destination.I am enthralled to watching movies and cricket.So pick a game from history or suggest me a movie,that should do for an interesting conversation!
